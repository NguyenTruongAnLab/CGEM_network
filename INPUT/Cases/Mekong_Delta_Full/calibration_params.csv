# STAGE 1: HYDRODYNAMICS + SALINITY (Key Savenije Parameters)
# =============================================================================
# Goal: Achieve 40-60 km salt intrusion in dry season (March 2025 validation)
#
# SAVENIJE THEORY KEY PARAMETERS:
# 1. LC (Convergence Length) - Controls exponential width decay W(x) = W0*exp(-x/a)
#    Shorter LC → faster convergence → different intrusion dynamics
#    MUST CALIBRATE for each ocean-connected branch
#
# 2. VDB_K - Van den Burgh K coefficient: Controls dispersion decay
#    Higher K → shorter intrusion (faster dispersion decay)
#
# 3. D0 - Dispersion at mouth: Direct control of salt transport magnitude

# Convergence length [m] - CALIBRATED from Stage 1 optimization
# Best RMSE = 9.21 achieved with these values
