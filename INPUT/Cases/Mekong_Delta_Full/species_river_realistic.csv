# River boundary conditions based on March 2025 field data
# Units: umol/L for concentrations, mg/L for SPM
# Values represent freshwater (upstream) endmember from validation data
#
# Key observations from HAU01, MT01, CC02, HL01 (upstream stations, dist > 65km):
# - Salinity: 0.1 PSU (fresh)
# - O2: 5.3-6.2 mg/L = 166-194 umol/L (undersaturated ~70-75%)
# - NO3: 0.11-0.18 mgN/L = 8-13 umol/L (LOW - LOWER than ocean!)
# - NH4: 0.02-0.07 mgN/L = 1.4-5 umol/L (very low)
# - DOC: 1.45-2.03 mgC/L = 121-169 umol/L (mean ~142)
# - Chl-a: 1-4.7 ug/L → PHY = 0.03-0.15 umol/L
# - Alkalinity: 1.28-1.36 mmol/L = 1280-1360 umol/L (mean ~1316)
# - pH: 7.35-7.60 (mean ~7.47)
# - pCO2: 3780-4720 ppm (HIGH! organic respiration, mean ~4200)
# - SPM: 9-18 mg/L (mean ~18)
# - DSi: 0.35-1.8 mgSi/L = 12-64 umol/L (mean ~30)
# - CH4: 1.5 ugC/L = ~125 nmol/L
# - N2O: 1.0 ugN/L = ~35 nmol/L
#
# CRITICAL CARBONATE CHEMISTRY:
# To get pCO2 ~4000 ppm with AT=1320 umol/L and pH=7.45:
# DIC must be ~1450-1500 umol/L (not too high, not too low)
