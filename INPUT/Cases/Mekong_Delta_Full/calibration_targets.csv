# Format: BranchName, Variable, Statistic, TargetValue, Weight [, Threshold]
#
# Statistic options:
#   INTRUSION_LEN  = Distance [km] where variable drops below threshold
#   TIDAL_RANGE    = Max - Min water level [m] at TargetValue km from mouth
#   MEAN           = Spatial mean over branch
#   MIN            = Minimum value over branch
#   MAX            = Maximum value over branch
#   ETM_LOCATION   = Distance [km] of SPM maximum
#
# Variables:
#   Hydro:   DEPTH, VELOCITY, WATERLEVEL
#   Species: SALINITY, O2, NO3, NH4, PO4, TOC, SPM, etc.
#
# Weights: Higher = more important in optimization
#          Typical: Tidal range (100), Intrusion (50), WQ (20-50)
