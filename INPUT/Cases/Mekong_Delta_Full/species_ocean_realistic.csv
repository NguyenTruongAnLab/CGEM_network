# Ocean boundary conditions - REVISED based on carbonate equilibrium consistency
# Observed at ocean: pH~8.1, pCO2~450-520, TA~2200-2260 umol/L
# For consistency: DIC~1900-2000 gives correct pCO2 with observed TA
#
# CRITICAL: DIC/TA ratio must be ~0.86-0.88 for pH~8.1
# Using DIC=1900, TA=2200 gives pCO2~350-400 (slightly supersaturated)
# Using DIC=1950, TA=2200 gives pCO2~450-500 (matches observations better)
#
# NO3 = 50-60 umol/L from validation data (high due to coastal upwelling)
# O2 = 255-265 umol/L (near saturation)
