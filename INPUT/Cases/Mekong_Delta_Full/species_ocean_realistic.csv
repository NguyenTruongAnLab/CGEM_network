# Ocean boundary conditions based on March 2025 field data
# Units: umol/L for concentrations, mg/L for SPM
# Values represent marine (ocean mouth) endmember from validation data
#
# Key observations from HAU12, MT10, CC11, HL10 (mouth stations):
# - Salinity: 27-31 PSU (mean 27.5 at <1km from mouth)
# - O2: 8.0-8.6 mg/L = 250-268 umol/L (saturated, ~105%)
# - NO3: 0.11-0.93 mgN/L = 8-66 umol/L (HIGHER at mouth due to coastal influence)
# - NH4: 0.01 mgN/L = 0.7 umolN/L (very low)
# - DOC: 1.3-2.3 mgC/L = 107-192 umolC/L
# - Chl-a: 2-7 ug/L → PHY = 0.1-0.2 umol/L
# - Alkalinity: 1.85-2.26 mmol/L = 1850-2260 umol/L (mean ~2100)
# - pH: 8.05-8.16 (mean ~8.1)
# - pCO2: 467-585 ppm (mean ~520, near equilibrium)
# - SPM: 8-35 mg/L (mean ~24 mg/L, variable due to ETM)
# - CH4: 0.5 ugC/L = ~40 nmol/L
# - N2O: 0.2 ugN/L = ~8 nmol/L
