# ============================================================================
# CASE 1: HAU RIVER - Single Branch Model
# ============================================================================
# Scientific Justification: Merged Dinh An + Tran De mouths into equivalent
# single outlet to create stable convergence length (Lb) for Savenije solver
#
# Data sources:
#   - Geometry: Nguyen et al. (2006), Vo Quoc Thanh (2021)
#   - Flow split: Jordan et al. (2019) - 40% of total Mekong discharge

# Branch_ID, Name, NodeUp, NodeDown, Length_m, Width_Up_m, Width_Down_m, Depth_m, Chezy, Group

# Hau Main: Chau Doc (Node 1) to Combined Mouth (Node 2)
# Length: 190 km (full estuary from border to sea)
# Width: Converges from 600m (upstream at Chau Doc) to 2300m (combined mouth)
# Depth: 12.5m (weighted average of Dinh An + Tran De)
# Chezy: 60 (typical for sandy alluvial estuary)
