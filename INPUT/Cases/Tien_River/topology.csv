# ============================================================================
# CASE 2: TIEN RIVER - Multi-Branch Model
# ============================================================================
# Scientific Justification: Three distributaries are long enough (>60 km)
# to support independent salt intrusion and require separate representation
# per Savenije (2012) convergence-length criterion (Lc/L > 1.5)
#
# Data sources:
#   - Geometry: Nguyen et al. (2006), Vo Quoc Thanh (2021)
#   - Flow split: Jordan et al. (2019) - 60% of total Mekong discharge
#   - Bifurcation location: My Thuan and Cho Lach
#
# Column format:
#   ID, Name, NodeUp, NodeDown, Length_m, Width_Up_m, Width_Down_m, Depth_m, Chezy, Group, RS, VDB_K
#
# RS (Storage Ratio): 
#   - 1.0 for prismatic channels (most river branches)
#   - 5-10 for mangrove/tidal flat areas (increases storage capacity)
#
# VDB_K (Van den Burgh coefficient):
#   - Controls dispersion decay: D(x) = D0 * exp(-K * x / a)
#   - LOWER K = slower decay = LONGER salt intrusion  
#   - HIGHER K = faster decay = SHORTER salt intrusion
#   - Typical range: 0.3-1.0 (Savenije 2005, 2012)

# 1. Tien Main Stem: Tan Chau (1) to My Thuan Split (2)
# Chezy increased to 65 for reduced friction (calibrated for Mekong, Nguyen et al. 2008)
# K=0.8 for main river (freshwater dominated)
1, Tien_Main, 1, 2, 100000, 1000, 1600, 15.0, 65, 2, 1.0, 0.80

# 2. Intermediate Connector: My Thuan (2) to Cho Lach Split (3)
# Short segment carrying flow for both Ham Luong and My Tho.
# K=0.8 for connector (freshwater dominated)
2, Tien_Connect, 2, 3, 16000, 1200, 1100, 14.0, 65, 2, 1.0, 0.80

# 3. My Tho Branch: Cho Lach Split (3) to Ocean (4)
# The northernmost branch (Cua Tieu/Dai).
# Chezy = 65 corresponds to Manning n ≈ 0.022 (calibrated Mekong value)
# K=0.75 for steeper salt intrusion gradient (prevents plateau)
3, My_Tho, 3, 4, 76000, 800, 1500, 11.0, 65, 2, 1.0, 0.75

# 4. Ham Luong Branch: Cho Lach Split (3) to Ocean (5)
# Splits from the connector, flows south-east.
# Chezy = 65 for proper tidal velocity and mixing (lower friction = more salt intrusion)
# K=0.75 for steeper gradient (was 0.50, caused plateau)
4, Ham_Luong, 3, 5, 84000, 850, 1800, 12.0, 65, 2, 1.0, 0.75

# 5. Co Chien Branch: My Thuan (2) to Ocean (6)
# Major distributary, splits off early.
# K=0.85 for moderate intrusion in long branch (100km)
