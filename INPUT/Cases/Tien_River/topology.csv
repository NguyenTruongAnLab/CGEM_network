# ============================================================================
# CASE 2: TIEN RIVER - Multi-Branch Model
# ============================================================================
# Scientific Justification: Three distributaries are long enough (>60 km)
# to support independent salt intrusion and require separate representation
# per Savenije (2012) convergence-length criterion (Lc/L > 1.5)
#
# Data sources:
#   - Geometry: Nguyen et al. (2006), Vo Quoc Thanh (2021)
#   - Flow split: Jordan et al. (2019) - 60% of total Mekong discharge
#   - Bifurcation location: My Thuan / Vinh Long area
#
# Column format:
#   ID, Name, NodeUp, NodeDown, Length_m, Width_Up_m, Width_Down_m, Depth_m, Chezy, Group, RS
#
# RS (Storage Ratio): 
#   - 1.0 for prismatic channels (most river branches)
#   - 5-10 for mangrove/tidal flat areas (increases storage capacity)

# 1. Tien Main Stem: Tan Chau (Node 1) to My Thuan Split (Node 2)
# Length: 100 km (Tan Chau gauge to first major bifurcation)
# Width: Converges from 1000m to 1800m
# Depth: 15m (main channel depth at MSL)
# Chezy: 60 (sandy alluvial bed)
# RS: 1.0 (main river channel)

# 2. Ham Luong Branch: Split (Node 2) to Ham Luong Mouth (Node 3)
# Length: 85 km (merged small creeks into main channel)

# Depth: 12m (distributary typical depth)
# Chezy: 55 (slightly more vegetation/friction)
# RS: 1.0 (main distributary)
