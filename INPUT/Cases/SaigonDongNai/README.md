# Saigon–Dong Nai Case Template

Use this folder to configure the Saigon–Dong Nai network. Replace `.template`
files with calibrated data prior to simulation.

Steps:
1. Derive branch geometry and update `topology.csv`.
2. Provide measured discharge and tide time series under `forcing/`.
3. Adjust `case_config.txt` to desired simulation window and outputs.
