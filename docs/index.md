# C-GEM Network

C-GEM (Carbon Generic Estuarine Model) Network is a multi-branch hydrodynamic and biogeochemical simulator for river-delta systems. This repository contains a multi-branch C implementation of CGEM using a staggered grid solver, legacy Fortran compatibility helpers, input configurations, and tools to produce NetCDF outputs and schematic visualizations.
